# Sam's News API - Backend.

This is a backend RESTful API created for the purpose of accessing, voting up and down, and commenting on a database of articles and their corresponding comments.

The database is PSQL, and the data is manipulated using the Knex JS library.

This repository migrates the raw data as supplied by the database files, and seeds them in such a way as to be usable to create an API.

The API is hosted on Heroku:
